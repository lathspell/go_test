= Learning GO

== Setup ==

All source code, my own as well as everything downloaded, resides
in one directory:

    export GOPATH=$HOME/go

Below that is `src/`, `modules/` and `bin/` which is suggested to be added
to the `PATH` variable.

Tools that are recommended are installed using go itself:

    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet
    go get github.com/golang/lint/golint

=== Tools ===

* Language Server - https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls
* Static Checker - https://staticcheck.io/
* Makefiles written in Go - https://magefile.org/
